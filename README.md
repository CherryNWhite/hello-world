A little reintroduction to developing

We are creating a new app that will help boating folk find a dock whilst out on the seas or on land before they go sailing.  This app will use GPS to find out their current location or a user modified location and look for docks that are currently available in that area.  The information about the dock is important too such as size, local amenities and other factors to be discussed with the DockForLess owner.
